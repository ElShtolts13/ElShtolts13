# Hi, I'm Nadezhda! 🧚‍♀️
I'm 28 years old and I live in Rostov-on-Don.

## About Me

💻 I'm a beginner iOS developer and I've been studying Swift for two years. I'm passionate about mobile app development and I strive to create useful and intuitive solutions.

## Current Projects

🌱 Right now, I'm participating in SWIFT MARATHON 14, where I'm honing my skills in UIKit and practicing teamwork. This is not my first marathon; 
I've previously participated in similar projects and even led a team in one of the educational challenges.
